**Problem**

I found a public dataset on AirBnB's website containing information about the numerous AirBnB rooms in New York City for the year of 2019. I decided to try and 
implement a prediction model which would help me predict the prizes of AirBnB listings in New York City for the year of 2019 
based on several geographical and availability metrics in the dataset.
